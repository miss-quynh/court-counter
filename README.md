<h1> Court Counter </h1>

<h4> Designed and implemented an interactive app that gives a user 
the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams (Cavaliers vs. Warriors) playing basketball </h4>

<p>The app allows a user to enter a countdown timer in minutes and keep track of the scores for the Cavaliers and the Warriors.
Once the time is up, a toast message appears to announce the appropriate winner.</p>
